pyTOX
=======

An encrypted p2p chat program
Proof of concept to build distributed applications using our chronus framework
based on work here: https://github.com/irungentoo/ProjectTox-Core/blob/master/README.md

intending to add features:
secure chatrooms
portability

New issues:
The current design of CHRONUS's message passing layer are lazy and insecure. This is a proof of concept not a product.
